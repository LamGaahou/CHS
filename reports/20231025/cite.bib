   abstract = {Thermochemical sorption energy storage (TSES) is the most recent thermal energy storage technology and has been proposed as a promising solution to reduce the mismatch between the energy supply and demand by storing energy for months in form of chemical bonds and restore it in form of synthesis chemical reaction. Compared with sensible/latent thermal energy processes, TSES system has major advantages, including a high energy storage capacity/density and the possibility of long-term energy retention with negligible heat loss. Therefore, a solid-gas thermochemical sorption battery is established and investigated utilizing a composite working pair of MgSO(4)-H(2)O based on room temperature expanded graphite (RTEG), treated with sulfuric acid (H(2)SO(4)) and ammonium persulfate ((NH(4))(2)S(2)O(8)) as a porous additive. The experimental results showed that energy storage density and sorption efficiency increase with the increment of charging temperature or decreasing of discharging temperature at a certain ambient temperature. Under experimental conditions, energy density ranged from 31.7 to 908.8 kJ/kg (corresponding to volume energy density from 11.7 to 335.8 MJ/m(3)), while sorption energy efficiency ranged from 28.3 to 79.1%. The highest values were obtained when charging, condensation, and discharging temperatures were 95, 20, and 15 degrees C, respectively. The maximum thermal efficiency was 21.1% at charging/discharging temperature of 95/15 degrees C with sensible to sorption heat ratio of 3:1.},

   abstract = {Chloride-based salt hydrates form a promising class of thermochemical materials (TCMs), having high storage capacity and fast kinetics. In the charging cycles of these hydrates however hydrolysis might appear along with dehydration. The HCl produced during the hydrolysis degrades and corrodes the storage system. Our GGA-DFT results show that the enthalpy charge during proton formation (an important step in hydrolysis) is much higher for CaCl(2).2H(2)O (33.75 kcal/mol) than for MgCl(2).2H(2)O (19.55 kcal/mol). This is a strong indicator that hydrolysis can be minimized by appropriate chemical mixing of CaCl(2) and Mg Cl(2) hydrates, which is also confirmed by recent experimental studies. GGA-DFT calculations were performed to obtain and analyze the optimized structures, charge distributions, bonding indicators and harmonic frequencies of various chemical mixtures hydrates and compared them to their elementary salts hydrates. We have further assessed the equilibrium products concentration of dehydration/hydrolysis of the chemical mixtures under a wide range of operating conditions. We observed that chemical mixing leads to an increase of the onset hydrolysis temperature with a maximum value of 79 K, thus increasing the resistance against hydrolysis with respect to the elementary salt hydrates. We also found that the chemical mixing of CaCl(2) and MgCl(2) hydrates widens the operating dehydration temperature range by a maximum value of 182 K (CaMg(2)Cl(6).2H(2)O) and lowers the binding enthalpy with respect to the physical mixture by approximately 65 kcal/mol for TCM based heat storage systems.},
